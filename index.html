            <h1>Plan your <br> own vacation</h1>
            <p>Fringed by the peaks of the Southern Carpathian Mountains and resplendent with gothic, baroque and renaissance architecture, Brasov is one of the most beautiful and visited places in Romania.
                Brasov was founded, in 1211, by the Teutonic Knights, on an ancient Dacian site. </p>

                <h4>Bran Castle</h4>
                <p>Positioned high atop a 200-foot-high rock and surrounded by an aura of mystery and folklore, owes its fame to its majestic towers and turrets as well as the mystique generated around Bram Stoker's Dracula. Bran fortress was first attested in an ordinance issued on November 19, 1377. Bran Castle boasts a commanding view of the charming village of Bran.</p>

                <h4>The Black Church</h4>
                <p>The construction of the church started in the 14th century, in the place of an even older religious edifice. It received the name Saint Mary after the patron saint of Brasov, a usual practice of the time. Its monumental dimensions had to impress locals enough to gain new adepts for the Catholic Church. Its size is impressive even today. TheBlack Church from Brasov is 90 meters long, 25 to 37 meters wide, 65 meters tall, with a capacity of receiving up to 5,000 people.</p>

                <h4>Tampa Mountain</h4>
                <p>Rising 940m high and visible around Braşov, Mt Tâmpa is adorned with its very own Hollywood-style sign. Hard as it is to imagine, it was the site of a mass-impaling of 40 noblemen by Vlad Țepeș. Banish such ghoulish images from your head as you take the cable car, or hike (about an hour), to reach a small viewing platform offering stunning views over the city. There's a cafe at the top.</p>
